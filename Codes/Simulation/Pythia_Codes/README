hadronization01 and hadronization02 were the codes
developed to control the hadronization process at
Pythia simulation level. hadronization02 is the 
final version where the ISR emission is restricted
to a single ISR jet.

The Makefile is an extension of the Makefile 
provided by Pythia developers. It contains
instructions to compile hadronization files
including StdHep libraries (in addition to 
Pythia libraries).

Further documentation can be found in the
Final report of this project, at the folder
documentation (of this reposiroty).
